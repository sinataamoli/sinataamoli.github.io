I am a Physics Ph.D. student, focused on observational extragalactic astronomy. Before that, I began my academic journey with a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and Physics in 2017, followed by an MSc in Physics in 2019, both from Sharif University of Technology. I am specialized in data-driven approaches and machine learning techniques to explore galaxy evolution using multiwavelength photometric catalogs and large spectroscopic surveys (e.g., COSMOS, COSMOS-Web, H20). My research focuses on analysis of Large Scale Structures, galaxy environments, and examining their role in shaping galaxy evolution.

I employ traditional methods, such as Hessian Matrix analysis, and advanced pattern detection algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, to identify components of the cosmic web (e.g., filaments, clusters) and assess their influence on galaxy properties such as star formation activity, stellar mass, and morphology using statistical techniques and Machine Learning algorithms, such as dimentionality reduction techniques.

In addition to my primary research, I am an active member of the [Euclid consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) and spectroscopy of high redshift protoclusters in the Euclid Deep Fields as a part of the [Hawaii Two-0 (H20)](https://project.ifa.hawaii.edu/h20/) survey. I am also interested in the very first stages of Astronomical research, which is data acquisition, data reduction, photometry technics and finally catalog making. I have been involved in more than 20 observing runs with Keck Telescope, and recently with JWST through "BEASTS in the bubbles" project.

In summary, I am experienced in:

Besides research, I love traveling, cooking, watching classic movies, listening to podcasts, and following online courses in areas I'm interested in!
