I am currently a Ph.D. student in observational extragalactic Astronomy. My research focus is primarily on utilizing data-driven approaches and Machine-Learning techniques to study galaxy evolution through multiwavelength photometric catalogs and large spectroscopic surveys (e.g., COSMOS, COSMOS-Web, H20). I am specifically interested in environmental dependence of galaxy properties and extracting different components of Cosmic-Web and study their impact on galaxy evolution.

I am currently utilizing newly developed pattern detection algorithms besides traditional approaches to extract and identify different components of Cosmic Web (e.g., filaments, clusters) and analyze the impact of diverse cosmic environments on galaxy properties, including but not limited to star formation activity, stellar mass, and morphology. 

Besides my main research, I am an active member of the **Euclid consortium** and lead spectroscopy of high redshift protoclusters in the Euclid Deep Fields as a part of the **Hawaii Two-0 (H20)** survey. I am also interested in the very first stages of Astronomy research, which is data acquisition and reduction, and have been involved in more than 20 observing runs with Keck Telescope, and recently with James Web through BEASTS project.

I began my academic journey with a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and Physics in 2017, followed by an MSc in Physics in 2019, both from Sharif University of Technology.

Besides research, I love traveling, hiking, cooking, watching classic movies, learning and teaching physics, astronomy, applications of Machine Learning in data driven research and even topics that I recently learnt myself and outreach activities!
