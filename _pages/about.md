I am a Ph.D. student in Physics with a concentration in observational extragalactic astronomy. My research focuses on understanding galaxy evolution and the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe by analyzing photometric and spectroscopic galaxy surveys. I specialize in data-driven approaches and machine learning techniques to study galaxy environments, their relation to LSS, and their role in shaping galaxy properties across cosmic time.

I employ traditional methods, such as Hessian Matrix analysis, and advanced pattern detection algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, to identify components of the cosmic web (e.g., filaments, clusters) and assess their influence on galaxy properties such as star formation activity, stellar mass, and morphology using statistical techniques and Machine Learning algorithms, such as dimentionality reduction techniques.

Throughout my Ph.D., I have actively contributed to several large collaborations. As part of the [Euclid consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/), I have worked on the analysis of Euclid Early Release Observations, including photometry, SED fitting, and catalog generation. Additionally, I have played a key role in the [Hawaii Two-0 (H20)](https://project.ifa.hawaii.edu/h20/) spectroscopic survey, leading observations and data reduction efforts. My research also extends to high-redshift studies with JWST, where I contributed to the BEASTS in the Bubbles project, analyzing some of the most distant and luminous galaxies observed to date.

Beyond research, I have developed a strong foundation in teaching and mentoring. I have been a teaching assistant for multiple courses, including Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization and Computer Graphics. I have also mentored undergraduate and graduate students through research projects, guiding them in data analysis techniques and machine learning applications in astronomy.

Before my Ph.D., I earned a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and Physics in 2017, followed by an MSc in Physics in 2019, both from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.
