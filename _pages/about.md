I am a Ph.D. student in Observational extragalactic astrophysics. I am interested in data-driven approaches to extracting information from multiwavelength photometric catalogs. I am working on environmental dependence of galaxy properties and extracting different components of Cosmic-Web in large photometric and spectroscopic surveys.

I am currently using COSMOS multiwavelength catalogs, as well as pattern detection algorithms to extract structural components of cosmic web and relate the galaxies physical properties, including their mass and their star-formation rate, to their environment. I am also a teaching assistant for various courses in both physics and engineering at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). 

I use the photometric and spectroscopic data from the largest ground and space based telescopes such as W. M. Keck Observatory, Subaru Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope and hopefully within few years I get the chance to observe with Thirty Meter Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and WFIRST.

I love traveling, backpacking, hiking, swimming, watching old movies, learning and teaching math, physics, astronomy, statistical learning, scientific visualization, and almost anything related to coding!
