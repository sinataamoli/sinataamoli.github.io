I am a Ph.D. student in Observational extragalactic astrophysics. I am interested in data-driven approaches to extracting information from multiwavelength photometric catalogs. I am working on environmental dependence of galaxy properties and extracting different components of Cosmic-Web in large photometric/spectroscopic surveys.

I am currently using COSMOS multiwavelength catalogs, as well as pattern detection algorithms to extract structural components of cosmic web and relate the galaxies physical properties, including their mass and their star-formation rate, to their environment. I am also a teaching assistant for various courses in both physics and engineering at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). 

I use the photometric and spectroscopic data from the largest ground and space based telescopes such as W. M. Keck Observatory, Subaru Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope and hopefully within few years I get the chance to observe with Thirty Meter Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and WFIRST.

I love traveling, backpacking, hiking, swimming, watching old movies, learning and teaching math, physics, astronomy, statistical learning, scientific visualization, and almost anything related to coding!

<!-- I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Carnegie Observatories. My research focuses primarily on analyzing comprehensive spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys, enhanced with artificial intelligence techniques, to study the formation and evolution of galaxies across diverse cosmic environments. I use a variety of methodologies, including large-scale distribution of galaxies and Lyman-Alpha tomography, to detect clusters of galaxies and their progenitors, known as protoclusters. I study how these extreme environments influence the evolution of galaxies, including but not limited to their star formation and metal enrichment histories.

At Carnegie I work with Dr. Drew Newman on the Lyman-Alpha Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which provides the largest Mpc-resolution 3D map of matter distribution at z~2.5 by observing the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of more than 3000 background Lyman-break galaxies. I utilize LATIS to study the emergence of environmental effects in galaxy evolution at cosmic noon.

Before joining Carnegie, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Irvine, where I worked with Prof. Asantha Cooray on various research topics. These included studying the gas-phase metallicity of ultraluminous infrared galaxies using Far-Infrared emission line diagnostics (click for more details) and contributing to the pre-launch studies focused on the galaxy formation objectives of the SPHEREx and newly launched Euclid missions. I am an active member of the Euclid consortium and lead spectroscopy of high redshift protoclusters in the Euclid Deep Fields as a part of the Hawaii Two-0 survey.

I earned my Ph.D. in March 2021, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, from the University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of Prof. Bahram Mobasher. During my Ph.D., I utilized the data from CANDELS and MOSDEF surveys to study the evolution of galaxies in different environments over cosmic time. Additionally, I developed methods employing state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques to maximize the scientific impact of current and upcoming space and ground-based observatories.

I began my academic journey with a BSc in Electrical Engineering in 2014, followed by an MSc in Physics in 2016, both from Sharif University of Technology. Even before setting foot in the university, my heart was captivated by the wonders of astronomy; a passion that led me to win a gold medal at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) in October 2009.

I am deeply passionate about mentoring and teaching. In the past, I mentored many high school students for the international astronomy olympiad. Furthermore, I've advised several undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds, helping them through exciting astronomy projects.

In my free time, when I'm not immersed in the joys of research and coding, I enjoy cooking delicious dishes, traveling, relaxing on the beach, singing karaoke, and exploring new destinations. -->
